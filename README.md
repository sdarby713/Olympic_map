# Olympic_map
https://sdarby713-ocities.herokuapp.com/

This produces an html map which shows locations of cities which have hosted the Summer Olympics, and indicates how many nations and athletes participated.

While interesting in itself, its main purpose is to supply the map portion to the Olympic History page.  See Olympic_History_Revisited for further details.

This code was originally stored in the repository Olympic_History, but it seems to me to be worthy of its own repository.
